                Battle Royale games</span> are a thrilling and competitive genre of video games that blend survival, 
                exploration, and scavenging elements of a survival game with last-man-standing gameplay.

                With no equipment or weapons at the outset, players must quickly scavenge for resources, weapons, and gear scattered throughout 
                buildings, landmarks, and other locations on the ground. </p>
