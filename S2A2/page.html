        <p class = "info">A car tire is a sophisticated engineering component that plays a
            critical role in vehicle performance, safety, and efficiency. 
            Constructed from an advanced blend of natural and synthetic rubbers, 
            reinforced with materials like carbon black for durability and silica for wet grip, 
            the modern car tire is a marvel of material science.</p>

            <p class = "info">Engines are the powerhouse of vehicles, coming in various types such as internal combustion engines (ICE), 
                electric motors, and hybrids, which blend ICE with electric propulsion for efficiency. ICEs, prevalent in most traditional
                 vehicles, combust fuel internally to generate power, and are classified into gasoline, diesel, and others based on the 
                 fuel used. Electric motors, found in electric vehicles (EVs), convert electrical energy into mechanical motion, 
                 offering high efficiency and torque.</p>

            <p class = "info">Jeep vehicles, renowned for their off-road capabilities, typically come equipped with a full-size 
                spare tire that matches the other tires on the vehicle, ensuring drivers can handle tire emergencies, 
                especially in remote or rugged terrains. This spare is often mounted on the exterior,
                 at the rear of vehicles like the Jeep Wrangler, to save interior space and for easy access. 
                 It's crucial for Jeep owners to regularly check the spare tire's condition and air pressure to 
                 ensure it's ready for use when needed. While some newer models might offer a compact spare or a tire repair 
                 kit instead, the presence of a full-size spare is a hallmark of Jeep's commitment to reliability and self-sufficiency 
                 in all driving conditions.</p>
