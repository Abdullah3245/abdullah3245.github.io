                <p>
                    The reading discusses mail art. At the. start, the author talks about how the sender influences
                    whether the contents of the letter are even important or significant to the receiver. Moreover, the
                    author shows his experience and skills as an artist explain how people can adapt and change their
                    mail art techniques so that the postal is an integral part of it. A question is raised I Mai Art
                    unpretentious? My take on this question would be art is subjective meaning the likability of it can
                    vary from person to person ;hence, it depends on the person the question is directed towards.

                    What does the author mean by "in Mail Art the terms of the equation are reversed"?

                    Why does the author use the term ""Big Monster"?</p>

                <h4><b>How Do You Use the Internet Mindfully</b></h4>
                <p>
                    In this passage, the writer asks a very basic but at the same time thoughtful question that what is
                    a website.
                    In broader terms every person who has used a computer knows what a website is. However thinking
                    about it from a designer perspective,
                    there are endless possibilities that pop up in the mind and the question "what is a website" turns
                    into a really complex one.
                    I loved how the writer included the photo of a bird and advising the basic computer skills that
                    someone in the age of tech show know.
                    I agree with the writer due to the integration of tech in every field know, I believe these skills
                    are important regardless of the field someone is in.
                    The idea of comparing of using personifications/metaphors(comparing them to objects) really
                    displayed the flexibility and vast application of websites.</p>

                <p>
                    The passage talks about the history which ,as a CIS student who is learning web design, is really
                    interesting and informative for me. The author stresses the importance of graphics in web dev also
                    back in the day which show how much graphics/art affect the world of web. The deletion of such a
                    large scale free web development platform was indeed a huge loss to web developer who has been in
                    this field from the start.



                    How would the web today be different if Geocities never existed?

                    Why did Yahoo exactly delete Geocites?</p>

                <p>
                    The passage talks about the purposes and the thought processes behind Alt text. How Alt text is
                    multi purposed , displaying image info in case the image does not load and also accommodating
                    visually impaired people. The writer describes to us how we can effectively and concisely describe
                    images using alt text. Poetry can be a great way to do that. This is because poetry can be
                    interpreted in different ways and one of the best forms of writing to describe a huge chunk of info
                    in a few lines.

                <p>
                    This was a rather complex passage for me. From what I can infer, the writer is discussing the
                    importance of language in succeeding in tech. How lack of proficiency can inhibit ability to perform
                    successfully in this field. The author moves at one point discusses how the lack of involvement from
                    people of the culture can lead to inaccuracies when that culture is represented by others who have
                    not sought revision from the natives. This confused me, as there have always been computer
                    scientists and graphic designers in the field from every part of the world who could have easily
                    identified these inaccuracies.

                    I do agree with the writer that, since English is a universal language, proficiency in it is pivotal
                    for succeeding in the field of technology.</p>

                <p>
                    The passage talks about the world of graphic design and internet with regards to post modernism. How
                    post modernism affect the creation of signs and symbols commonly used in the internet. Graphic
                    designer visually represent object as icon instead of grids and icons. The passage then introduces
                    Disney's design as the as a symbol of globalization and American hegemony, and for the de-signers
                    who use it

                    What was the author's main purpose of discussing about Walt Disney graphics?

                <p>
                    Dot Tuer writes about Vera Frenkel's art thing called "String Games," where she played around with
                    videos and tech stuff back in 1974 to tell stories about forgetting things and how images go around
                    in our electronic world. Frenkel was doing something pretty new by mixing up live video chats
                    between cities way before everyone was doing it on the internet. Tuer says Frenkel was kind of ahead
                    of her time, doing cool things with screens and games that made people think about how we remember
                    or lose memories with all this tech. But, it turns out, not many people really got how important
                    this "String Games" was until much later, which Tuer thinks is because it was a bit too smart or
                    different from the usual techy art stuff. The writing tries to show how Frenkel's old video game is
                    a big deal for understanding the fancy art and memory stuff with computers and screens.

                    Why do you think it took so long for people to appreciate Vera Frenkel's "String Games"?</p>

                    her local community. She is working on a school project about computers but finds herself learning
                    about the past and how people connect with each other. By the end, Gem discovers that her community
                    and the advice they give, called 'The Beyond' in the story, is just as important as her computer
                    work.

                <p>
                    The passage describe internet as a global platform for uploading information. It is a platform where
                    art and literature can be given the same importance as military information. The internet has
                    allowed artist to remain a greater audience. As stated in the passage, art is a subjective and the
                    internet has allowed artist and user access to start they specifically find appealing.
                    Why does the author describe the internet as hell and heaven at the same time?
